    "This lecture, the computer lab exercises were replaced by a demo of building a simple data lake with [minio](https://min.io/), which is a lightweight open source object storage. You can try it out by following these [instructions](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html). \n",

    "Bilal also generously shared his guide for installing on linux, to make sure `chmod` is run with sudo privileges:\n",

    "<blockquote> \n",
    "So for anyone who wants to experiment with MINIO on Linux, I have spent an awful lot of time here and there and you could save time. Here's the installation instructions for it. Depending on your system architecture choose one of the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* AMD64  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio  \n",

    "* PPC64LE\n",
    "    \n",
    "        wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-ppc64le/minio\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now the next step is to change the permissions and make it into an executable, in my case, I had to do it as SUPERUSER. That can be done with:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sudo -s\n",
    "    [Enter Password as prompted]\n",
    "    su\n",
    "    #Now you're in superuser\n",
    "    \n",
    "Just use   `chmod +x minio`   to make your installation into an executable.\n",
    "Finally to start your own MINIO Server, just use the following command:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ./minio server /(foldername)\n",
    "The default settings shall let you access it at http://localhost:9000/ . The username and password are both `minioadmin` at default.\n",
