    "The demo used [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch) and [kibana](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/kibana), which are both part of the [elk stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack). Here's how to [get started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/7.6/get-started-elastic-stack.html), but if you're interested, I recommend starting with the [introduction](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html) which defines useful terms and concepts.\n",
