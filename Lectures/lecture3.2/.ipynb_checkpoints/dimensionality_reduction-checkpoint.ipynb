    "\n",
    "- Use dimensionality reduction to compress images\n",
    "- Implement PCA on an emoji dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "In the lecture slides, we have seen a toy example of PCA which projected a 2D dataset down to 1D. But we have also learned that dimensionality reduction shines when applied to datasets with many dimensions. We saw how pictures were good examples, since they have as many dimensions as they have pixels.\n",
